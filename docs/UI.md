## Purpose

To converge one one desireable design -- The UI should feel like a premium digital collectible album, not a game HUD.

## Core Design

- Design the UI with a clean, sterile, modern collectible-game aesthetic inspired by Pokémon TCG Pocket.
- Prioritize soft gradients, light backgrounds, and high visual breathing room.
- Use rounded cards, pill-shaped buttons, subtle shadows, and low-contrast dividers.
- The interface should feel calm, airy, and polished, never dense or noisy.
- Avoid harsh borders, heavy outlines, dark themes, or saturated UI chrome.
- Typography should be simple, friendly, and highly legible, with generous line height and clear hierarchy.
- Animations should be slow, smooth, and minimal, emphasizing delight over feedback.

## Layout and Spacing

- Use large margins and generous padding throughout.
- Favor fewer elements per screen over compact efficiency.
- Center important content in floating cards with soft drop shadows.
- Treat empty space as a first-class design element, not wasted space.

## Color and Surface

- Base the UI on light neutral surfaces (off-white, very pale blue, soft gray).
- Accents should use muted pastels or gentle gradients, never pure primaries.
- Use color sparingly to highlight actions or rarity, not for structural layout.
- Backgrounds should feel frosted, airy, and slightly luminous, not flat white.

## Component Styling

UI components should appear soft and touch-friendly:
- Rounded corners (medium–large radius)
- Subtle elevation via light shadow or glow
- No visible borders unless necessary
- Buttons should feel like “floating pills,” not boxes
- Interactive states should use opacity, scale, or glow, not sharp color changes.

## Motion and Interaction

- Animations should feel gentle and reassuring, never snappy or aggressive.
- Prefer fade, slide, and scale transitions with easing curves.
- Avoid fast bounces, elastic motion, or gamey particle effects in the base UI.
- The UI should feel like it’s inviting interaction, not demanding attention.

## Anti Patterns

Explicitly avoid:
- Dark themes
- High-contrast black/white layouts
- Dense grids or data-table layouts
- Sharp corners or heavy borders
- Loud gradients, neon accents, or saturated UI chrome
- Admin-dashboard or productivity-app aesthetics
